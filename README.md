# water-extraction
Ongoing work on extracting water from a subglacial hydrologic system. 

SHAKTI-ISSM files are contained in the folder "/pumping_repo/" whereas variable flux analysis is in the folder "/variable_flux/"

The other files contain analysis for the fixed flux model including
- fixed_b: model for constant gap height
- inner_piece_Dhat: model for flux envelope near the borehole
- nds_2km: model that sweeps through effective pressure
